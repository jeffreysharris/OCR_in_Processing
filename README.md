Simple Optical Character Recognition in Processing
Jeff Harris

This sketch employs a 2D histogram of live video feed, and compares it to the 2D histogram for a template glyph. At present, only 2 jpgs are in the data set, (capital A and B). No HMMs or preceptron networks here. This sketch uses OpenCV for Processing, written by Greg Borenstein (github/atduskgreg).
